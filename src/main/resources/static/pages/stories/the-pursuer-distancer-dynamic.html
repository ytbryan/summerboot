            <p>
              According to experts, the most common reason couples fall out of
              love and stop being sexually intimate is because of a
              pursuer-distancer dynamic that develops over time. Sue Johnson
              identifies this pattern as the “protest polka,” and says it is one
              of three “demon dialogues.” She explains that when one partner
              becomes critical and aggressive, the other often becomes defensive
              and distant. John Gottman’s research on thousands of couples
              reveals that partners who get stuck in this pattern in the first
              few years of marriage have more than an 80 percent chance of
              divorcing in the first four or five years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why is this relationship pattern so common? Gottman found that men
              tend to withdraw and women tend to pursue when they are in
              intimate relationships. Further, he explains that these tendencies
              are wired into our physiology and reflect a basic gender
              difference. In his classic “Love Lab” observations, he notes that
              this dynamic is extremely common and is a major contributor to
              marital break-down. He also warns us that if it’s not changed, the
              pursuer-distancer dynamic will persist into a second marriage or
              subsequent intimate relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              Partners in intimate relationships tend to blame the other person
              when their needs are not being met. A pursuer-distancer dance
              follows, which intensifies the dynamic. Couples report having the
              same fights repeatedly. After a while, they’re no longer
              addressing the issue at hand and a vicious cycle of resentment,
              frustration, and anger develops and never gets resolved.
            </p>
            <p>
              While all couples need autonomy and closeness, many partners
              struggle with the pursuer-distancer dance and feel chronically
              dissatisfied with their degree of intimacy. When the pattern of
              pursuing and distancing becomes ingrained, the behavior of one
              partner provokes and maintains the behavior of the other. It’s
              normal to feel a sense of disappointment when your desire for
              emotional and sexual intimacy doesn’t match your partner’s, and a
              pursuer-distancer dynamic can develop in the bedroom. While this
              dynamic is one of the most common causes of divorce, don’t panic!
              Lacking sexual intimacy is a common struggle for hard-working
              couples balancing jobs, parenting, and intimacy.

                >In Wanting Sex Again: How to Rediscover Your Desire and Heal a
                Sexless Marriage</em
              >, sex therapist Laurie J. Watson writes, “Most sexual concerns
              stem from an interpersonal struggle in the marriage.” She
              describes the tug-of-war between being too close and too distant
              from a partner as a repetitive pattern of one person being the
              pursuer and another being the distancer.
            </p>
            <p>
              In many cases, the distancer retreats and seeks out alone time
              when under stress, and this intensifies their partner’s need for
              closeness, thus their desire to pursue. The problem is that if
              this pattern becomes deeply entrenched, neither person gets their
              needs met. Sometimes a distancer realizes too late that their
              partner is severely distressed and they have already started
              making plans to end their relationship.
            </p>
            <h5>How to Deal with a Distancer or Pursuer</h5>
            <p>
              Let’s examine how the pursuer-distancer dynamic usually works by
              looking at a typical scenario with Suzanne and Keith, whom you met
              earlier. Suzanne’s demands for more sexual intimacy are her way of
              motivating Keith to open up, so she can gain reassurance from him.
              In this case, the ways that Suzanne and Keith respond to each
              other backfire, creating a negative pattern of interpersonal
              relating.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Let’s talk about why we’re not spending time together anymore,”
              Suzanne complains, as her husband reads the newspaper and turns
              away from her bids for connection. She says, “How can we get along
              if we don’t work on our problems?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Keith responds, “I’m not sure what problems you’re talking about.
              We’re getting along okay. All couples go through hard times.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Suzanne feels increasingly frustrated with her attempts to draw
              out Keith. Meanwhile, Keith resorts to his typical distancer
              strategy, perhaps stonewalling her attempts to communicate by
              giving her the silent treatment. As she continues to express more
              disappointment in Keith, he further withdraws. If this pattern
              isn’t reversed, it’s easy to see how they can both begin to feel
              criticized and develop contempt for each other — two of the major
              warning signs that their marriage is doomed to fail, according to
              John Gottman.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s no wonder that many of the interactions between couples
              become deadlocked in the pursuer-distancer dynamic. Partners can
              end up in a stalemate and are left feeling bitter and
              disillusioned about their marriage. Repair work begins with
              expressing your intent in a positive way and taking responsibility
              for your part in this negative cycle. This can be done by saying
              things such as “I’d really appreciate it if you’d cook dinner
              tonight since I’m behind on projects at work and need to work
              late.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Without recognizing it, many pursuers come on stronger than they
              intend to, not realizing that being in the “pursuit mode” may
              cause their distant partner to withdraw even more. Likewise, by
              pulling back, a distancer may cause their pursuer partner to
              pursue more vehemently. Watson suggests that couples entrenched in
              this pattern try switching roles to find out firsthand what it’s
              like to walk in their partner’s shoes. This can be a way to
              enhance empathy, awareness, and possibly even jump-start a new
              behavioral pattern of initiating and responding to sexual advances
              from your partner.
              <p> In general, most couples can balance their
                needs for closeness and separateness in terms of sexual intimacy
                if they develop more vulnerability, compassion, and sensitivity to
                their partner’s needs, both inside and outside of the bedroom. A
                good first step is to establish more emotionally intelligent
                dialogue that allows both people to feel heard and validated.</p>

              <h5>Dialogue to Grow Closer Together</h5>
              <p>
                Partner A: I feel left out when you don’t open up to me. I’d
                like to know what you’re thinking when I share my feelings with
                you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Partner B: It sounds like you’d like me to share more of my
                thoughts with you when you’re talking about your feelings. I can
                work on that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Partner A: I feel hurt when you read the paper when we’re eating
                dinner because I’d like to learn more about your day and get
                close to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Partner B: You’d like me to be more engaged with you during
                dinner. I wasn’t aware that your feelings were hurt. I do get
                tired in the evening after working all day, but I’ll try to
                interact more because it’s important to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Partner A: When we have loving sex, I feel closer to you. I’d
                like to talk about ways we can please each other sexually and
                both get our needs met.
              </p>
              <p>
                Partner B: I feel closer to you too, even though it’s hard for
                me to open up and talk about sex. Let’s try to find ways we can
                both get our needs met sexually and be more intimate.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              Practiced daily, this type of dialogue will create a stronger
              emotional and sexual connection between you and your mate. Couples
              who spend at least thirty minutes daily in conversation with each
              other and express love, affection, and admiration will foster a
              closer bond and thrive both in and out of the sheets.
