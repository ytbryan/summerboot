            <p><em>Difficult conversations can lead to flooding.</em></p>
            <p>
              Here are steps to remain calm while staying present for yourself
              and your partner. Difficult conversations can lead to flooding.
              Learn how to set conversational boundaries without stonewalling.
              During stressful times, it can be challenging to have
              conversations with friends and family about sensitive topics
              without getting uncomfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think about the last time you had a difficult conversation that
              upset you. Did you want to just leave? Did you feel that you
              needed to control yourself from saying what you truly felt? Did
              you choose not to respond? To shut down? Did you want to avoid a
              fight, but then felt resentful? Did you blow up and say things
              that you later wished you could take back?
            </p>
            <h5>Flooding leads to Stonewalling</h5>
            <p>
              Dr. John Gottman’s research shows that in ailing relationships
              there is heightened physiological arousal during conflict
              discussions called “flooding.” Flooding happens in other
              relationships with friends, coworkers, parents, siblings, in-laws,
              etc. For most people, when they are flooded, their heart rate
              rises to over 100 beats per minute. You feel overwhelmed and
              intensely stressed. Your capacity to hear and understand someone
              else is limited. In this state of mind, you are more likely to say
              or do something you will later regret.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, flooding isn’t good for your health. It suppresses
              your immune system, which makes you more susceptible to infectious
              illnesses. So when you find yourself flooding, it is important to
              take a break and self-soothe (i.e., engaging in an activity like
              deep breathing that takes you away from the upsetting thoughts and
              calms your nervous system). If you don’t do this, most likely you
              will end up Stonewalling—disengaging and emotionally withdrawing
              from the interaction. You cannot have a conversation that
              validates and creates harmony. It is also upsetting for your loved
              one to speak to a Stonewalling listener. Your stony silence is not
              neutrality or setting a boundary. It communicates disapproval and
              emotional distance.
            </p>

            <p>
              How can you manage stressful conversations without Stonewalling?
            </p>

            <div class="actionable-steps">
              <h5>Self-soothing</h5>
              <p>
                One helpful coping method is self-soothing. This is the antidote
                to Stonewalling.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Do you hold your breath when you’re upset? Make sure you’re
                  breathing.
                </li>
                <li>Check-in with yourself and validate your feelings.</li>
                <li>
                  Ask yourself what you need to feel centered. Give yourself
                  permission to go in another room to cool down or out for a
                  walk outside.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let your physical senses ground you. Touch something and focus
                  on how it feels. Sip and truly taste some tea. Listen to a
                  calming song. Notice items in the room that you may have never
                  observed before. Inhale through your nose and note any smells.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              It takes at least 20 minutes for your physiology to return to a
              calm baseline state. Try not to continue thinking about the
              upsetting situation (especially coming up with better responses
              you wish you could say). This puts gasoline on your upset
              feelings. Breathe. Focus. Relax your tensed muscles.
            </p>
            <h5>Practice acceptance</h5>
            <p>
              Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT, a modality developed by
              Steven Hayes, Ph.D.) explains the concept of “acceptance”
              beautifully. Acceptance means the willingness to open up and make
              space for uncomfortable feelings, sensations, urges, and emotions.
              You try not to control your inner experience or someone else’s
              perspective. Instead of fighting the feelings you experience
              internally, try to accept them without judgment as appropriate
              responses to these situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may think that acceptance sounds like “giving up,” but it’s
              not. It’s merely dropping the internal struggle that causes
              anxiety and stress. You can still have opinions and beliefs and
              communicate in a way that respects your values and sets healthy
              boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another concept in ACT is “committed action,” meaning you take
              effective action based on your values. What can you do to advocate
              for what you believe in? How can you communicate what’s important
              to you without jeopardizing your emotional wellbeing?
            </p>
            <p>
              Be an example of what you stand for. Others are more likely to
              change by your example than by the arguments you “win.” By
              practicing acceptance before you start the conversation, you also
              create space where you can truly listen to someone else’s feelings
              and points of view.
            </p>
            <h5>Setting boundaries</h5>
            <p>
              Learn how to set conversational boundaries without stonewalling.
              Setting boundaries is an important aspect of establishing who you
              are as a person and how others are allowed to treat you. As a
              crucial part of mental health, it also includes learning to be
              kind towards yourself. As a result, you can be less reactive,
              since you set the rules you live by and let others know of them as
              well. One example is letting someone know that if they have
              discussions with you where they are being disrespectful, you will
              end the conversation because it takes a toll on you. An example of
              how to say this could look like: “I’ve noticed that when we have
              discussions about this topic, I feel drained. I’d like to have
              this conversation with you, but only if you are willing not to
              make personal attacks. If you continue to do so, I will walk away
              from this conversation.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Boundary setting informs the other person what your limits are and
              then enforces them. This is an act of kindness towards yourself
              and someone else.
            </p>
            <p>
              Life can be difficult. Let’s be compassionate towards ourselves
              and others. Let’s see the cup half full, not half empty. Even
              better, let’s self-soothe, practice acceptance, and communicate
              healthy boundaries so that our cups are full.
